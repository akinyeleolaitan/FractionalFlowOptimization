# FractionalFlowOptimization

* Unzip the folder provided to you or copy and paste contents to an accessible location for Matlab
* Launch Matlab software 
* Use Matlab to locate the folder which holds the contents 
* Locate FractionFlowCEOR.m right click and run to deploy GUI for water and surfactant input data 
* The "compute" button executes the forward calculations of the fractional flow theory 
* The "Optimize" button launches the optimization environment to perform the inversion modelling of the fractional flow theory based on measured flow parameters
* On the optimization GUI, the " Search Space" button launches the multiobjective function for the optimal solution. 
* The solution can be manually adjusted on the optimization GUI to ensure solution converges
* Do check if your Matlab software version supports GUI applications and optimization Apps for curve fitting.
